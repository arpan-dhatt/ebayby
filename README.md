A school project.

Made a frontend for a hypothetical application where people shop for babies as if they are shopping for laptops. Meant to simulate a future application where designer babies are possible and commercializable.

Mostly a thought experiment. We learned how dehumanizing it was when you could modify the characteristics of your child at will. Also, as a dystopian capitalist society, diseriable qualities of a baby are put behind exorbitant prices, increasing inequality.

Don't take this too seriously, lol.
